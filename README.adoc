{name} is a library that provides an enhanced version of the https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#pdf-type[type] function that looks for `__type` metafield on a table and userdata.
For best performance it’s implemented both in Lua (for LuaJIT) and C (for Lua/PUC).


The Lua builtin function `type` has a disadvantage: it only returns a “primitive” Lua type of a value.
So if you want to implement your own typing system with custom type names, `type` won't provide you any interesting information:

[source]
local chair = setmetatable({}, { __type = 'Chair' })
print(type(chair))  -- prints 'table'

Some libraries (such as the I/O library included with standard Lua) offer alternative type functions for identifying types used within that library:

[source, lua]
local value = io.open('/dev/null')
print(io.type(value))  -- prints 'file'

{name} allows you to define your own type tags:

[source, lua]
----
local type = require('mtype').type

local chair = setmetatable({}, { __type = 'Chair' })
print(type(chair))  -- prints 'Chair'

print(type('allons-y!'))  -- prints 'string'
print(type(io.open('/dev/null')))  -- prints 'file'
----

{name} is _very_ simple: it looks for a `\__type` metafield on a table.
If it’s a function, it passes the value to the function and uses the result as the type name.
If it’s a string, it uses that. If `__type` is `nil` or returns `nil`, the builtin `io.type` or `type` is used.

== Installation

You can install {name} using https://luarocks.org[LuaRocks] (the Lua package manager):

[source, subs="+attributes"]
luarocks install {name}

or to get the latest development version:

[source, subs="+attributes"]
luarocks install --server=http://luarocks.org/dev {name}

Note: If you want to bootstrap development environment for running tests, read the next section.


== Set up development environment

. Clone this repository:
[source, subs="+attributes"]
git clone https://github.com/{gh-name}.git
cd {name}

. Source file `.envrc` into your shell (or manually add `$(pwd)/.venv/bin` to your `PATH`):

    source .envrc

. Install Lua and modules for running tests into directory `.venv`:

    ./script/bootstrap

. Start hacking!

* Build native extension:

    ./script/build

* Run tests and linters:

    ./script/test

* Run benchmarks:

    lua bench.lua


== Performance

=== Lua 5.3.4

|===
| value                    | type | mtype (pure) | mtype (native)

| number                   | 1.0  | 2.3          | 1.1
| string                   | 1.0  | 2.2          | 1.2
| table without __type     | 1.0  | 5.0          | 1.6
| table with string __type | 1.0  | 4.9          | 1.4
| table with func __type   | 1.0  | 6.3          | 2.4
|===


=== LuaJIT 2.1 (disabled JIT)

|===
| value                    | type | mtype (pure) | mtype (native)

| number                   | 1.0  | 1.7          | 2.7
| string                   | 1.0  | 1.7          | 2.6
| table without __type     | 1.0  | 2.4          | 3.3
| table with string __type | 1.0  | 2.6          | 2.6
| table with func __type   | 1.0  | 2.9          | 3.0
|===

Note: These numbers are measured with disabled JIT, so they represent the _worst case_.
When you run this benchmark with enabled JIT, then “type” and “mtype (pure)” finishes basically in no time.
